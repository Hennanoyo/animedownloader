# Project Status

## Current Phase

The persistent Episode download workflow is complete. The next phase is the frontend Anime Detail / Episode Management UI that will expose the backend download workflow.

### PR #7 — Torrent Infrastructure

### PR #8 — Episode Download Execution

Merged into `main` as commit `a8610bb1cb39c508b64e9d9111b67b39412fc32f`.

- Added `POST /api/episodes/{episode_id}/download-jobs`
- Added Taskiq dispatch through Redis
- Added Worker-side `DownloadRunner` orchestration
- Reused qBittorrent torrents by per-job tag across worker restarts/retries
- Persisted qBittorrent progress and terminal state to PostgreSQL
- Added duplicate active-job handling
- Added deterministic API/runner coverage
- Added Worker runtime verification to CI

CI passed for PR #8 with Backend, Frontend, and Integration checks.

## Current Workflow

```
Browser
  → Nyaa search
  → select release
  → create Anime + Episodes
  → PostgreSQL
  → create persistent DownloadJob
  → enqueue Taskiq task
  → worker
  → TorrentClient / qBittorrent
  → persist DownloadJob progress/state
```

## Next Phase — Frontend Anime Detail / Episode Management

Build the frontend against the now-stable backend workflow:

- Anime detail view
- Anime edit/delete
- Episode list and metadata
- Per-episode download action
- Persistent DownloadJob status/progress display

The frontend should remain separate from the backend execution implementation so API/worker behavior can continue to be tested independently.

## Out of Scope for This Phase

Do not expand the first download workflow into later media pipeline stages:

- media inspection
- subtitle normalization
- transcoding
- HLS/DASH packaging
- SeaweedFS upload

These should remain separate follow-up phases.

## Handoff Notes

For a new development session, use this document together with `AGENTS.md`, the relevant architecture and decision documents, the current open pull request, and recent commits. Treat the repository state as authoritative and update this file when the project phase changes.
